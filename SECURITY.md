Thanks for helping make **AtScale** Inc projects safe for everyone.

## Security

AtScale takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [AtScale](https://github.com/AtScaleInc).

Even though [open source repositories are outside of the scope of our bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/index.html#scope) and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any AtScale-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**
